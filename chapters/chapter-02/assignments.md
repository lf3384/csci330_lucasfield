## üéØ Core Assignment 1: Type System Exploration (60 minutes)
*Comprehensive project combining fundamental types, conversions, and practical applications*

### Part A: Type Discovery and Analysis (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Build a comprehensive understanding of C++ type system through systematic exploration

Create a program called `type_explorer.cpp` that:

**Basic Type Analysis:**
1. Declare and initialize variables of each fundamental type: `int`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `long`, `float`
2. Use `sizeof` to show the size in bytes of each type
3. Display the range limits using `<climits>` and `<cfloat>` (e.g., `INT_MAX`, `DBL_MAX`)
4. Show both positive and negative values for signed types

**Type Conversion Investigation:**
5. Demonstrate implicit conversions (int to double, char to int, etc.)
6. Show explicit casting with `static_cast<>`
7. Demonstrate information loss in narrowing conversions
8. Compare conversion results with and without explicit casting

**Expected Output** (partial example):
```
=== C++ Type System Analysis ===
Fundamental Types:
  int: 42 (size: 4 bytes, range: -2147483648 to 2147483647)
  double: 3.14159 (size: 8 bytes, precision: ~15-17 digits)
  char: 'A' (size: 1 byte, ASCII: 65)
  bool: true (size: 1 byte, values: 0 or 1)
  
Type Conversions:
  int(42) -> double: 42.000000 (no loss)
  double(3.14159) -> int: 3 (precision lost!)
  char('A') -> int: 65 (ASCII value)
  
Explicit vs Implicit:
  Implicit: 42 + 3.14 = 45.14 (int promoted to double)
  Explicit: static_cast<int>(3.14) = 3
```

### Part B: Practical Application - Multi-Unit Converter (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Apply type knowledge in a comprehensive conversion utility

Extend your program to include a multi-unit converter that handles:

**Temperature Conversions:**
- Celsius ‚Üî Fahrenheit ‚Üî Kelvin
- Handle integer inputs but provide precise double outputs
- Show the impact of integer vs floating-point arithmetic

**Distance Conversions:**  
- Miles ‚Üî Kilometers ‚Üî Meters
- Feet ‚Üî Meters ‚Üî Inches

**Requirements:**
1. Use appropriate types for each unit (int for counts, double for precise measurements)
2. Demonstrate the difference between integer and floating-point division
3. Format output with appropriate precision
4. Handle common conversion scenarios with test cases

### Part C: Memory Behavior and Scope Analysis (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Explore memory behavior, initialization, and scope rules

Create a comprehensive analysis program that demonstrates:

**Initialization Behavior:**
1. Uninitialized local variables (show unpredictable values)
2. Global variable auto-initialization (show zero-initialization)
3. Const variable initialization requirements
4. Impact of uninitialized variables on program behavior

**Scope Investigation:**
5. Global vs local variable precedence
6. Block scope with nested braces `{ }`
7. Variable shadowing in different scopes
8. Lifetime differences between stack and global variables

**Memory Layout:**
9. Compare addresses of global vs local variables
10. Show how local variables get different addresses in different function calls

**Safety Analysis:**
11. Compile with warnings enabled (`-Wall -Wuninitialized`)
12. Document which initialization errors the compiler catches vs misses

**Files**: `type_explorer.cpp`
**Time Estimate**: 90 minutes total
**Skills Developed**: Type system mastery, conversion understanding, scope awareness, debugging mindset

## üéØ Core Assignment 2: Memory and Data Structures (75 minutes)
*Comprehensive project integrating arrays, pointers, and structs for real-world data management*

### Part A: Student Grade Management System (40 minutes)
**Objective**: Build a comprehensive grade management system using arrays, pointers, and structs

Create a program called `student_manager.cpp` that manages multiple students and their grades:

**Data Structures:**
1. Create a `Student` struct with: name (char array), student_id (int), grades array, grade_count
2. Create an array to store multiple students (at least 3 students)
3. Use both stack arrays and demonstrate pointer arithmetic

**Core Functionality:**
4. Initialize sample data for 3 students with varying numbers of grades
5. Calculate individual student averages using pointer arithmetic
6. Find class-wide statistics (highest/lowest individual averages, overall class average)
7. Implement safe array access with bounds checking
8. Sort students by average grade (simple bubble sort)

**Memory Safety:**
9. Demonstrate safe vs unsafe array access
10. Show what happens with out-of-bounds access (controlled demonstration)
11. Use assert() statements for debugging array bounds

**Expected Output** (partial):
```
=== Student Grade Management System ===
Student: Alice Johnson (ID: 1001)
  Grades: [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]
  Average: 87.8
  
Student: Bob Smith (ID: 1002)  
  Grades: [90, 87, 93]
  Average: 90.0
  
Class Statistics:
  Highest Average: Bob Smith (90.0)
  Lowest Average: Alice Johnson (87.8)
  Class Average: 88.9
  
[Memory Safety Demo]
  Safe access: grades[2] = 78
  Unsafe access: grades[10] = [undefined/crash]
```

### Part B: Advanced Memory Operations and Pointers (45 minutes)
**Objective**: Master pointer arithmetic, memory layout, and dynamic operations

Extend your student management program with advanced memory operations:

**Pointer Operations:**
1. Rewrite array processing functions using pointer arithmetic instead of indices
2. Create functions that take pointer parameters: `calculate_average(int* grades, size_t count)`
3. Demonstrate pointer vs array notation equivalence
4. Show memory addresses of array elements (demonstrate contiguous layout)

**Advanced Array Operations:**
5. Implement a generic `safe_access` function template that works with any array type
6. Create array copying functions using pointers
7. Implement array search functions (linear search using pointers)
8. Build a simple "database" query system (find students by ID, by grade range)

**Memory Layout Investigation:**
9. Print addresses of struct members to understand memory layout
10. Show the difference between array of structs vs struct of arrays
11. Demonstrate memory alignment concepts with sizeof() on structs

**Error Handling:**
12. Implement comprehensive bounds checking for all array operations
13. Create error reporting system (error codes vs exceptions preview)
14. Build defensive programming practices into all functions

**Files**: `student_manager.cpp` (extended from Part A)
**Time Estimate**: 90 minutes total (45 + 45)
**Skills Developed**: Memory management, pointer arithmetic, struct design, defensive programming
