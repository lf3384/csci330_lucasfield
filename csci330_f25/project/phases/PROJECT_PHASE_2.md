# Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
**Duration**: Weeks 4-6  
**Due**: End of Week 6  
**Points**: 60 (20% of project grade)  
**Goal**: Get a basic working version

## Your Phase 2 Todo List

### Week 4-5: Build Core (~3 hours/week)
□ Create your main classes/structures  
□ Get the basic functionality working end-to-end  
□ Focus on "it works" not "it's perfect"  
□ Use what you've learned in class (RAII, references, etc.)

### Week 6: Clean Up (~3-4 hours)
□ Fix any obvious bugs  
□ Add basic error handling (don't crash on bad input)  
□ Write a few tests for main functions (If you want to jump ahead, you can skim chapter 10 and the chapter 10 notes, but you can use AI to help with this as well!) 
□ Update README with how to use it

### Before Your Check-in
□ Make sure it compiles and runs  
□ Run valgrind's memcheck, a program analysis tool,  once (fix major leaks if any)  
□ Push to GitHub  
□ Do 2 peer reviews  
□ **Check-in Meeting**: Demo your MVP, get feedback

## What Success Looks Like
- Your program works end-to-end for the basic use case
- Proper C++ practices (RAII, const-correctness, references)
- No memory leaks or undefined behavior
- Someone else could build and run your code
- Ready to add interesting features in Phase 3

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Feature creep - keep it minimal but complete
- Ignoring memory management until later
- Hardcoding values instead of using configuration
- Skipping tests "to save time"

*Remember: MVP means "barely works but actually works." Focus on completeness over features.*
