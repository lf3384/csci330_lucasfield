# Phase 1: Planning & Proof of Concept
**Duration**: Weeks 1-3  
**Due**: End of Week 3  
**Points**: 40 (13% of project grade)  
**Goal**: Pick a project and prove the core idea works (Note: this isn't a minimal viable product!)

## Learning Path Note

**Remember**: You can use ANY C++ features you need, even if they haven't been covered in class yet. If your project needs vectors, file I/O, or classes - research them, use them, and document them. The course chapters will provide deep understanding later, but don't let that stop you from using what you need now. This is how real development works!

## Your Phase 1 Todo List

### Week 1-2: Planning (~2 hours/week)
□ Browse PROJECT_BRAINSTORMING_GUIDE.md for ideas  
□ Pick a project that interests you  
□ Write a 1-page proposal with:
  - What you're building
  - Why it's interesting to you
  - Your main technical challenge
□ Set up GitHub repository

### Week 3: Proof of Concept (~3-4 hours)
□ Code the hardest part first (just get it working)  
□ Don't worry about pretty - focus on "does it work?"  
□ Write a simple test to show it works  
□ Add a README with build instructions

### Before Your Check-in
□ Push code to GitHub  
□ Post a screenshot to Project Collaboration Hub  
□ Do 2 quick peer reviews  
□ Schedule your 15-minute meeting  
□ **Check-in Meeting**: Show what works, get feedback

## What Success Looks Like
- You've proven the hardest technical challenge is solvable
- Your code compiles and runs (even if ugly)
- You have a clear plan documented
- You've engaged with the class community
- You're ready to build the MVP in Phase 2

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Starting with the easy parts (UI, menus) instead of core functionality
- Picking a project that's too ambitious or too simple
- Working in isolation without peer feedback
- Not pushing code to GitHub regularly
