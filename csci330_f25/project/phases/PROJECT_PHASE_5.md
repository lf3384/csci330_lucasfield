# Phase 5: Polish & Presentation
**Duration**: Weeks 13-15  
**Due**: Finals Week  
**Points**: 60 (20% of project grade)  
**Goal**: Wrap it up and show it off

## Your Phase 5 Todo List

### Week 13: Final Polish (~3 hours)
□ Make it look presentable  
□ Update README with:
  - How to build and run it
  - What it does (with screenshots if possible)
  - Basic usage examples
□ Clean up obvious code issues

### Week 14: Reflection (~2 hours)
□ Write 3-4 page reflection covering:
  - What you built and why
  - What was harder/easier than expected
  - How you used AI (be specific)
  - What you learned
□ Prepare your demo

### Week 15/Finals: Presentation
□ Practice your demo once  
□ Submit everything to Canvas  
□ **Final Presentation** (20 minutes):
  - Show it working (7 min)
  - Walk through interesting code (10 min)
  - Answer questions (3 min)

### Before Your Presentation
□ Make sure it runs on demo day  
□ Have backup plan if demo fails  
□ Know your code well enough to explain it  
□ Complete final peer reviews

## What Success Looks Like
- Professional, portfolio-ready project
- Clear documentation anyone could follow
- Smooth, impressive demo
- Thoughtful reflection on learning
- Pride in what you've built

## Presentation Tips
- Start with the "wow" feature
- Have backup plan if demo fails
- Know your code inside and out
- Be honest about challenges faced
- Show enthusiasm for your work

## Reflection Paper Sections
1. **Technical Journey**: Architecture evolution, key algorithms, C++ features mastered
2. **Development Process**: Time management, biggest surprises, pivotal moments
3. **AI Collaboration**: How you used AI, what worked, what didn't
4. **Future Vision**: What you'd add, how you'd refactor, real-world applications

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Cramming new features instead of polishing
- Weak documentation
- Unprepared for presentation questions
- Not testing demo beforehand
