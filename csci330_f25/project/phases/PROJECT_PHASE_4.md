# Phase 4: Robustness & Performance
**Duration**: Weeks 10-12  
**Due**: End of Week 12  
**Points**: 70 (23% of project grade)  
**Goal**: Make it solid and reliable

## Your Phase 4 Todo List

### Week 10-11: Make It Robust (~3 hours/week)
□ Test with bad/weird inputs - it shouldn't crash  
□ Fix the most important bugs  
□ Add better error handling where needed  
□ Run valgrind and fix any memory leaks

### Week 12: Final Testing (~4 hours)
□ Test the complete workflow several times  
□ Make sure your tests actually pass  
□ Clean up your code (consistent style)  
□ Finalize documentation

### Optional (if you have time)
□ Profile and optimize slow parts  
□ Add GitHub Actions for automatic testing  
□ Try stress testing with large inputs

### Before Your Check-in
□ Ensure it doesn't crash on edge cases  
□ All tests pass  
□ Push to GitHub  
□ Do 2 peer reviews  
□ **Check-in Meeting**: Show it's bulletproof

## What Success Looks Like
- Your program doesn't crash with weird inputs
- Performance is acceptable for intended use
- Another developer could maintain your code
- Professional development practices in place
- Ready for real-world deployment

## Testing Checklist
- Boundary conditions
- Empty/null inputs
- Very large inputs
- Concurrent access
- Resource exhaustion
- Interrupted operations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Optimizing before profiling
- Ignoring edge cases as "unlikely"
- Breaking features while optimizing
- Inadequate error messages
