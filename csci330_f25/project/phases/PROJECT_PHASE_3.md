# Phase 3: Feature Development
**Duration**: Weeks 7-9  
**Due**: End of Week 9  
**Points**: 70 (23% of project grade)  
**Goal**: Make your project actually interesting

## Your Phase 3 Todo List

### Week 7-8: Add Features (~3 hours/week)
□ Add 2-3 features that make your project useful/fun  
□ Try using some C++ features from class:
  - STL containers (vector, map, etc.)
  - Maybe a template if it makes sense
  - Smart pointers if you're doing dynamic allocation
□ Improve error messages

### Week 9: Polish (~4 hours)
□ Fix any annoying bugs  
□ Make the user experience smoother  
□ Add tests for new features  
□ Update documentation

### Before Your Check-in
□ Make sure new features actually work  
□ Push to GitHub  
□ Share your coolest feature in Project Collaboration Hub  
□ Do 2 peer reviews  
□ **Check-in Meeting**: Show off new features

## What Success Looks Like
- Your project does something impressive beyond basics
- Appropriate use of C++ features (not forced)
- Better performance than MVP version
- Features that users actually want
- Clean, maintainable code structure

## Feature Ideas by Project Type
- **Games**: Levels, AI, save/load, achievements
- **Tools**: Multiple formats, batch processing, plugins
- **Databases**: Indexing, joins, transactions, queries
- **Network Apps**: Multiple clients, protocols, encryption

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Adding features nobody asked for
- Over-engineering simple problems
- Using advanced C++ features just to use them
- Breaking existing functionality
