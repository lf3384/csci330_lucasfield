# CSCI 330 - Semester-Long C++ Project

## Overview

This is an audacious project:  I'm asking you to build a substantial C++ application over the course of the semester using professional software development practices. This project runs parallel to your coursework - you can use whatever C++ features you've learned (or research on your own) at any point. AI is a tool and you can use AI, but you must credit where you use AI and be able to explain every aspect of your code, your development enviornment, and the development process.  

**Duration**: Full semester (15 weeks)  
**Weight**: 30% of course grade (300 points)  
**Philosophy**: This is serious project, so I expect you to build something real, substantial, and portfolio-worthy

> **ðŸ“š How to Use These Documents:**  
> - Start here for the complete project overview ("map of the world")
> - Use the individual phase guides (PROJECT_PHASE_1.md through PROJECT_PHASE_5.md) for detailed todo checklists
> - Each phase guide breaks down the work into manageable weekly tasks
> - Check off items as you complete them to track your progress

## Important: Two Parallel Learning Paths

**This project runs parallel to, not in lockstep with, the course chapters.** You're encouraged to use ANY C++ features you need at ANY point - whether from research, AI assistance, or looking ahead in the textbook. 

- **The Chapters** provide deep, systematic understanding of C++ concepts (types, memory models, function mechanics, container internals)
- **The Project** provides real-world context where you use whatever works to solve problems

You might use `std::vector` in Phase 1 before studying Chapter 11 on containers in detail. This is by design and mirrors professional development - you often use tools to solve problems first, then later develop deeper understanding of their internals. The "lightbulb moment" when you formally study something you've already used in your project is valuable learning.

**Bottom line**: Don't wait for permission from the chapters to use a feature. If you need it, research it, use it, and document it. The formal study will come later and deepen your understanding.

## AI Usage Policy

### Philosophy
Use AI as you would in a professional setting - as a tool to enhance productivity while maintaining ownership and understanding of your code.

### Required Documentation (Integrated into Phase Deliverables)
Each phase submission must include an AI usage section documenting:
- Significant AI interactions during this phase
- Specific prompts used and responses received
- What you implemented vs. what AI suggested
- What you learned from these interactions
- How your AI usage evolved from the previous phase

### Guidelines
- **Always Allowed**: Debugging, syntax help, documentation generation
- **Document When Used**: Algorithm suggestions, design patterns, optimization
- **Not Acceptable**: Having AI write entire features without understanding

### Semester-Long AI Documentation
Track your AI collaboration evolution:
- Phase 1: Learning C++ basics and project planning
- Phase 2: Architecture decisions and implementation help  
- Phase 3: Advanced feature development and optimization
- Phase 4: Debugging, performance tuning, and robustness
- Phase 5: Reflection on the entire AI collaboration experience

## Success Tips

### Start with the Hard Part
Don't build the easy UI first. Solve the core technical challenge in Phase 1.

### Keep It Working
Never break your build for more than a day. Always have a working version.

### Test as You Go
Don't save testing for the end. Write tests with your features.

### Use Version Control Properly
- Commit often with meaningful messages
- Use branches for major features
- Tag each phase submission

### Get Feedback Early
- Show your project to others
- Get user feedback
- Don't work in isolation

### Document Decisions
Keep notes on why you made certain choices - you'll need them for the reflection.

### Use the Project Collaboration Hub
- **Post weekly progress updates** to get community feedback and stay motivated
- **Ask technical questions** when you're stuck - your classmates may have solved similar problems
- **Share breakthroughs and discoveries** - help others learn from your experience  
- **Help others debug** - explaining solutions reinforces your own understanding
- **Build professional relationships** - your classmates today are your network tomorrow

## FAQ

**Q: Can I change my project idea after Phase 1?**
A: Yes, but talk to the instructor first. Better to pivot early than fail later.

**Q: What if my Phase 1 proof of concept reveals my idea won't work?**
A: That's valuable! Pivot to your backup plan. Finding out early is the point.

**Q: Can I use external libraries?**
A: Yes! Document them and be able to explain what they do.

**Q: How much should I use AI?**
A: As much as helps you learn and be productive. Document it all.

**Q: What if I'm way ahead/behind schedule?**
A: Talk to the instructor. We can adjust scope or provide extra challenges.

**Q: Can I work on something related to my research/job?**
A: Absolutely! Real projects are the best projects.

**Remember**: This is YOUR project. Make something you're proud of, that you'll want to show in job interviews, and that demonstrates your growth as a C++ developer.
