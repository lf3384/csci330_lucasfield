## üìö Core Concepts: C++ vs Python/Java (2.5 hours)

**üìñ Bridge to Textbook**: Now that you've read about C++ program structure in Chapter 1, let's connect those concepts to the Python/Java knowledge you already have.

### 1. Program Structure & Entry Point

The textbook explained that every C++ program needs a `main()` function. Here's how this compares to languages you know:

| Language | Entry Point | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **C++** | `int main() { return 0; }` | Required; returns exit code to OS |
| **Python** | No explicit main | Convention: `if __name__ == "__main__":` |
| **Java** | `public static void main(String[] args) {}` | Must be inside a class |

**Key Insight**: C++ `main()` is like Python's `if __name__ == "__main__"` block - it's where your program starts.

### 2. The Compilation Process

**From Textbook to Context**: The textbook covered C++ compilation. Here's how it compares to the interpreted languages you know:

| Language | Process | When Errors Found |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| **C++** | Source ‚Üí Machine Code ‚Üí Run | Compile time |
| **Python** | Source ‚Üí Run (interpreted) | Runtime |
| **Java** | Source ‚Üí Bytecode ‚Üí Run on JVM | Compile time |

**What this means**: C++ catches many errors before your program runs, making it faster but requiring an extra step.

### 3. Including External Code

```cpp
#include <cstdio>  // Like Python's import, but happens at compile time
```

| Language | How to Import | When Processed |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **C++** | `#include <header>` | Before compilation |
| **Python** | `import module` | At runtime |
| **Java** | `import package.Class;` | At compile time |

### 4. Variables and Types

**C++ requires explicit types** (like Java, unlike Python):

```cpp
int age = 25;        // Must specify 'int'
double price = 9.99; // Must specify 'double'  
char grade = 'A';    // Single character
```

| Aspect | C++ | Python | Java |
|--------|-----|--------|------|
| **Type Required** | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Type Changes** | No | Yes | No |
| **Declaration** | `int x = 5;` | `x = 5` | `int x = 5;` |

### 5. Output to Console

```cpp
printf("Hello, World!\n");           // Basic output
printf("I am %d years old\n", age);  // With variables
```

| Language | Basic | With Variables |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **C++** | `printf("Hi\n");` | `printf("Age: %d\n", age);` |
| **Python** | `print("Hi")` | `print(f"Age: {age}")` |
| **Java** | `System.out.println("Hi");` | `System.out.printf("Age: %d\n", age);` |

### 6. Functions

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {    // Return type required
    return a + b;
}
```

| Language | Function Definition |
|----------|-------------------|
| **C++** | `int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }` |
| **Python** | `def add(a, b): return a + b` |
| **Java** | `public static int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }` |

**Key Point**: C++ functions must specify return type and parameter types.

## üß© Hands-On Problems (2.25 hours)

**üìñ Ready to Apply**: You've read the textbook and reviewed the Python/Java connections above. Now let's put that knowledge to work with hands-on practice that prepares you for the assignments.

### Problem Set 1: First Steps (45 minutes)

#### Problem 1.1: Your Personal Introduction
Write a program that prints:
- Your name
- Your favorite programming language (Python or Java)
- One reason you're excited to learn C++

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    // TODO: Add your printf statements here
    return 0;
}
```

**Expected output example**:
```
My name is Alex
My favorite language is Python
I'm learning C++ to build faster programs
```

#### Problem 1.2: Understanding Compilation
Create this program and deliberately make these mistakes to see the error messages:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n")  // Remove semicolon - what error do you get?
    return 0;
}
```

1. **Remove the semicolon** - compile and note the error message
2. **Fix it and try removing** `#include <cstdio>` - what happens?
3. **Fix it and try changing** `main()` to `main` - what's the error?

**Learning Goal**: Understand common compiler errors so you can fix them quickly.

#### Problem 1.3: Compilation Practice
Save your program as `intro.cpp` and practice the compile-run cycle:

```bash
# Compile
g++ -o intro intro.cpp

# Run
./intro          # Mac/Linux
intro.exe        # Windows (if using Windows compiler)
```

**Document**: What happens at each step? Time yourself - how long does compilation take?

### Problem Set 2: Variables and Types (45 minutes)

#### Problem 2.1: Temperature Converter
Convert 25¬∞C to Fahrenheit using: F = (C √ó 9/5) + 32

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int celsius = 25;
    // TODO: Calculate fahrenheit and print both values
    return 0;
}
```

**Expected output**: `25¬∞C = 77¬∞F`

**Extension**: Try with `double` instead of `int`. What's different about the result?

#### Problem 2.2: Your First Function
Write a function to calculate the square of a number:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

// TODO: Write the square function here
int square(int x) {
    // Your code here
}

int main() {
    int num = 7;
    int result = square(num);
    printf("%d squared is %d\n", num, result);
    return 0;
}
```

**Expected output**: `7 squared is 49`

#### Problem 2.3: Multiple Variables
Create a program that uses different variable types:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int age = 20;
    double height = 5.8;    // feet  
    char grade = 'A';
    
    // TODO: Print all three variables in one sentence
    // Example: "I am 20 years old, 5.8 feet tall, and got an A grade"
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Challenge**: Figure out the correct `printf` format specifiers for each type.

### Problem Set 3: Control Flow (55 minutes)

#### Problem 3.1: Simple Decisions
Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int num = -5;  // Try different values
    
    // TODO: Use if/else to print whether num is positive, negative, or zero
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Problem 3.2: Grade Calculator
Convert a numeric grade to letter grade:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int score = 87;  // Try different scores
    
    // TODO: Convert to letter grade (A: 90+, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: <60)
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Problem 3.3: Simple Loop
Print numbers 1 through 5 using a for loop:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    // TODO: Write a for loop that prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (each on its own line)
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Python Connection**: This is like `for i in range(1, 6):`

## üîß Quick Reference & Troubleshooting

### Top 5 Compiler Errors

| Error Message | Cause | Fix |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| `expected ';'` | Missing semicolon | Add `;` at end of statement |
| `'printf' was not declared` | Missing include | Add `#include <cstdio>` |
| `expected '(' before` | Wrong function syntax | Use `main()` not `main` |
| `undefined reference to main` | No main function | Add `int main() { return 0; }` |
| `expected '}'` | Missing brace | Match every `{` with `}` |

### Printf Format Specifiers

| Type | Specifier | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `int` | `%d` | `printf("Number: %d\n", 42);` |
| `double` | `%f` | `printf("Price: %.2f\n", 9.99);` |
| `char` | `%c` | `printf("Grade: %c\n", 'A');` |
| `string` | `%s` | `printf("Name: %s\n", "Alex");` |

### Compilation Commands

```bash
# Basic compilation
g++ program.cpp -o program

# With debug info (recommended while learning)
g++ -g -Wall program.cpp -o program

# Run the program
./program        # Mac/Linux
program.exe      # Windows
```

### VS Code Shortcuts

| Action | Windows/Linux | macOS |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Build** | Ctrl+Shift+B | Cmd+Shift+B |
| **Terminal** | Ctrl+` | Cmd+` |
| **Command Palette** | Ctrl+Shift+P | Cmd+Shift+P |
