## üéØ Problem Set 1: Constructor and Destructor Basics (45 minutes)
*Understanding object lifecycle through practical examples*

### Problem 1.1: Simple Bank Account (25 minutes)
**Objective**: Master constructor/destructor patterns through a complete banking system

Create a program called `banking_system.cpp` that implements:

**Base Account Class:**
1. Create a `BankAccount` base class with:
   - Multiple constructors (default, balance, full account info)
   - Copy constructor and assignment operator
   - Virtual destructor with logging
   - Account number generation (static counter)
   - Balance management with validation

**Specialized Account Types:**
2. Implement derived classes:
   - `SavingsAccount` (with interest rate)
   - `CheckingAccount` (with overdraft protection)
   - `BusinessAccount` (with transaction limits)

**Lifecycle Demonstration:**
3. Create accounts using different constructors
4. Show object creation/destruction order in nested scopes
5. Demonstrate copy behavior and resource management
6. Track total accounts created/destroyed (static members)

### Problem 1.2: Constructor Types (20 minutes)  
**Objective**: Apply RAII principles for transaction safety and logging

Extend your banking system with automatic resource management:

**Transaction Logger (RAII):**
1. Create a `TransactionLogger` class that:
   - Opens log file in constructor
   - Automatically closes file in destructor
   - Ensures all transactions are logged even if exceptions occur
   - Demonstrates stack-based resource management

**Safe Transaction Operations:**
2. Implement transaction safety:
   - Atomic transfer operations (all-or-nothing)
   - Automatic rollback on failure
   - Exception-safe balance updates
   - Resource cleanup even when operations fail

**Advanced RAII Patterns:**
3. Create utility classes demonstrating RAII:
   - `AccountLock` (prevents concurrent access)
   - `BalanceBackup` (automatic restoration on failure)
   - `AuditTrail` (automatic compliance logging)

**Expected Output** (partial):
```
=== Banking System with RAII Demo ===
[Constructor] Account #1001 created: John Doe, $1000.00
[Constructor] Account #1002 created: Jane Smith, $1500.00
[Constructor] Business Account #1003: Acme Corp, $10000.00

[Transaction Log] Transfer initiated: #1001 -> #1002, $200.00
[RAII Logger] Transaction log opened: bank_transactions.log
[Success] Transfer completed successfully
[RAII Logger] Transaction log closed automatically

[Destructor] Account #1003 destroyed: Final balance $9800.00
[Destructor] Account #1002 destroyed: Final balance $1700.00  
[Destructor] Account #1001 destroyed: Final balance $800.00

Summary: 3 accounts created, 3 accounts destroyed, 1 transfer completed
```

**Skills Developed**: Constructor overloading, virtual destructors, RAII patterns, exception safety

## üéØ Core Assignment 2: Resource Management Framework (2 hours)
*Advanced memory management system showcasing dynamic allocation and smart resource handling*

### Part A: Dynamic Memory Manager (60 minutes)
**Objective**: Build a comprehensive memory management system with proper cleanup

Create `resource_manager.cpp` implementing:

**Resource Manager Class:**
1. Design a `ResourceManager` template class that:
   - Manages dynamic arrays of any type
   - Provides safe allocation/deallocation
   - Prevents memory leaks through RAII
   - Supports resizing and copying

**Dynamic Student Database:**
2. Apply the resource manager to build:
   - Dynamic student record system
   - Automatic capacity expansion
   - Safe copying and assignment
   - Memory usage tracking and reporting

**Memory Safety Demonstrations:**
3. Create scenarios showing:
   - What happens without proper cleanup (controlled leaks)
   - Automatic cleanup with RAII
   - Exception safety during allocation
   - Resource cleanup in complex inheritance hierarchies

### Part B: Advanced Lifecycle Patterns (60 minutes)
**Objective**: Master complex object relationships and lifecycle dependencies

Extend your resource manager with advanced patterns:

**Dependency Management:**
1. Implement objects with dependencies:
   - Parent objects that own child objects
   - Shared resources with reference counting
   - Circular dependency detection and prevention
   - Ordered destruction based on dependencies

**Factory Pattern with RAII:**
2. Create object factories that:
   - Manage object creation and registration
   - Provide automatic cleanup on program exit
   - Handle creation failures gracefully
   - Maintain object inventories and statistics

**Integration with Banking System:**
3. Combine both assignments:
   - Use resource manager for account storage
   - Implement account pools with automatic cleanup
   - Create report generators with RAII file handling
   - Build complete system with proper resource lifecycle

**Performance Analysis:**
4. Compare different approaches:
   - Stack vs heap allocation performance
   - RAII overhead vs manual management
   - Memory fragmentation analysis
   - Constructor/destructor call overhead

**Files**: `banking_system.cpp`, `resource_manager.cpp`
**Time Estimate**: 4 hours total (2 + 2)
**Skills Developed**: Advanced RAII, memory management, object relationships, performance optimization

## üèÜ Challenge Exercises (OPTIONAL - for advanced students)

### Challenge 1: Smart Pointer Implementation (45 minutes)
**Objective**: Build your own smart pointer classes

Implement basic smart pointers before learning STL versions:
1. Create `unique_ptr` equivalent with move semantics
2. Implement `shared_ptr` with reference counting
3. Add `weak_ptr` to break circular references
4. Build comprehensive test suite
5. Compare performance with raw pointers

### Challenge 2: Exception-Safe Programming (40 minutes)
**Objective**: Master exception safety guarantees

Create robust classes with different safety levels:
1. Basic guarantee (no leaks, but object may be in altered state)
2. Strong guarantee (rollback on exception)  
3. No-throw guarantee (operations never fail)
4. Implement exception-safe container class
5. Build automatic testing for exception scenarios

### Challenge 3: Custom Memory Allocators (50 minutes)
