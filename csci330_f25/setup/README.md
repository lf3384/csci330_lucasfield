**⚙️ Professional C++ Development Environment**

This directory contains everything needed to set up your complete C++ development environment using industry-standard tools.

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (New Students)

### **Complete Setup Process**
1. **📋 [Development Environment Setup](DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md)** - **START HERE**
   - Install Docker Desktop and VS Code
   - Configure C++ development environment
   - Set up Git and GitHub integration
   - **Time**: 30-45 minutes

2. **📖 [Git Workflow Guide](GIT_WORKFLOW.md)** - **CRITICAL FOR SUBMISSIONS**
   - Professional Pull Request workflow
   - Branching and submission strategies
   - Academic integrity guidelines
   - **Time**: 15-20 minutes to read, lifetime to master

3. **✅ [Environment Verification](test_integration.sh)** - **VALIDATE YOUR SETUP**
   ```bash
   cd setup/
   ./test_integration.sh
   ```
   All tests should pass (Docker daemon test may fail if Docker not running)

## 🛠️ Setup Components

### **Core Development Tools**
- **🐳 [Docker Environment](docker-compose.yml)** - Consistent C++ environment
- **⚙️ [Docker Configuration](Dockerfile)** - Container definition with all tools
- **💻 VS Code Integration** - Professional IDE with debugging support
- **📝 Git Workflow** - Industry-standard version control

### **Included Development Stack**
- **Compiler**: g++ with modern C++ support (C++17/20)
- **Build System**: CMake for professional project management
- **Debugger**: GDB with VS Code integration
- **Testing**: Catch2 testing framework
- **Memory Tools**: Valgrind and Address Sanitizer
- **Code Quality**: clang-format for consistent styling

## 🎯 Development Approaches

### **🌟 Recommended: Docker + VS Code**
- **Pros**: Consistent environment, professional debugging, integrated tools
- **Best for**: Most students, cross-platform consistency
- **Setup Guide**: [DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md](DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md)

### **⚡ Alternative: Docker CLI**  
- **Pros**: Lightweight, fast startup, Linux expertise building
- **Best for**: Command-line enthusiasts, resource-constrained systems
- **Quick Start**:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d cpp-dev
  docker-compose exec cpp-dev bash
  ```

### **🖥️ Local Installation**
- **Pros**: No Docker overhead, direct system access
- **Cons**: Platform-specific issues, inconsistent environments
- **Not recommended** unless specific requirements

## 📋 Environment Features

### **Professional Debugging**
- **Visual debugging** with breakpoints and variable inspection
- **Memory visualization** for pointer and array operations
- **Step-through debugging** for understanding program flow
- **Integrated terminal** for quick testing

### **Build and Test Integration**
- **CMake integration** for professional project structure
- **Automated testing** with Catch2 framework
- **Continuous compilation** with file watching
- **Error highlighting** and IntelliSense support

### **Git Integration**
- **VS Code Git interface** for visual version control
- **Pull Request workflow** built into development process
- **Commit history visualization** and diff tools
- **Branch management** for feature development

## 🔧 Common Setup Issues

### **Docker Problems**
- **Windows**: Ensure WSL2 is enabled and Docker Desktop has proper permissions
- **macOS**: Grant Docker Desktop access to directories and verify correct architecture (Intel vs Apple Silicon)
- **Linux**: Ensure user is in docker group and Docker daemon is running

### **VS Code Integration**
- **Extensions**: Ensure C++ Extension Pack and Remote Containers are installed
- **Container Connection**: Use "Reopen in Container" command for Docker integration
- **IntelliSense**: May need to rebuild container or restart VS Code

### **Git Configuration**
- **Identity**: Set up course-specific Git identity with proper name format
- **Authentication**: Configure GitHub access tokens or SSH keys
- **Remotes**: Ensure both origin (your fork) and upstream (course repo) are configured
