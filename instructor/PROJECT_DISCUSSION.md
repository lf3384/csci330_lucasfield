# Semester Project Collaboration Hub

## Welcome to Your Project Development Community

This discussion is your central space for collaboration on the semester-long C++ project. This is where real learning happens‚Äîthrough sharing progress, solving problems together, and helping each other overcome challenges.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Your participation here directly supports the peer feedback requirements built into each project phase. Active engagement builds the professional habits expected in real software development teams.

## What to Post

### üìà Project Updates & Progress
- Weekly snapshots with screenshots or code snippets
- Key architecture decisions and milestones
- Examples: "Week 3: Proof-of-concept parser working," "Switched to smart pointers"

### üÜò Help Requests
- Technical roadblocks and design tradeoffs
- Include error messages, code snippets, and what you've tried

### üí° Helping Others
- Solutions that worked for you
- Useful resources or documentation

### üë• Peer Feedback Requests
- Code review invitations with specific questions
- Architecture validation and review requests

## Participation Guidelines

**üéØ Quality > Quantity:** One thoughtful post beats ten "me too" comments

**üîß Professional Tone:** Constructive, specific, respectful‚Äîlike a workplace code review

**üìÖ Regular Engagement:** Aim for meaningful contribution each week (15‚Äì20 minutes)

**ü§ñ AI Transparency:** Used ChatGPT/Copilot? Note what it helped with vs. what you wrote

## How You'll Be Graded

**You'll use this discussion throughout the semester. The grades for your participation will be added through individual checkpoint assignments. All you need to do is add to the discussion, and I'll use your contributions to evaluate your grade for each of the checkpoints.**

**Total Points: 21**
- **Discussion Participation**: 1 point (Complete/Incomplete)
- **Four Checkpoint Evaluations**: 5 points each (20 points total)

| Checkpoint | Week | What I'm Looking For |
|------------|------|---------------------|
| Initial Engagement | 3‚Äì4 | Project setup, early challenges, first attempts to help others |
| Midpoint Progress | 7‚Äì8 | Architecture discussions, problem-solving, peer support |
| Collaboration Peak | 11‚Äì12 | Quality peer reviews given/received, community building |
| Final Contribution | 14‚Äì15 | Reflection on growth, helping others finish strong |

### Grading Rubric (Per Checkpoint)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 points (Excellent) | Weekly posts, substantive content, actively helps others |
| 3 points (Satisfactory) | Bi-weekly posts, solid updates, some peer interaction |
| 1 point (Minimal) | Rare posts, surface-level content, little or no collaboration |

## Why This Matters

- The help you give/receive here makes the difference between struggling alone and succeeding together
- These collaboration skills are what employers actually care about
- Your classmates today are your professional network tomorrow

**‚è±Ô∏è Time Investment:** 15‚Äì20 minutes weekly‚Äîless time than debugging alone, better results than working in isolation.

**Remember:** Every senior developer was once stuck on the same problems you're facing. The difference? They learned to ask for help and help others. Start building that habit now.

## Instructor Notes

### Canvas Setup
1. Create a single discussion board titled "Semester Project Collaboration Hub"
2. Set as ongoing discussion (not weekly modules)  
3. Pin to top of discussions
4. Enable threading for organized conversations
5. Set discussion as graded: 1 point (Complete/Incomplete)

### Grading Implementation
**Two-Part Grading System:**

**Part 1 - Discussion Grade (1 point):**
- Canvas discussion set to 1 point, Complete/Incomplete
- Complete = participated meaningfully throughout semester
- Incomplete = minimal or no participation

**Part 2 - Checkpoint Assignments (20 points):**
- Create 4 separate assignments in gradebook:
  - "Project Discussion Checkpoint 1" (5 points, due Week 4)
  - "Project Discussion Checkpoint 2" (5 points, due Week 8) 
  - "Project Discussion Checkpoint 3" (5 points, due Week 12)
  - "Project Discussion Checkpoint 4" (5 points, due Week 15)
- Use SpeedGrader's rubric feature with the 3-tier rubric
- Students don't submit anything to assignments - you grade based on discussion participation
- Schedule grading reminders for weeks 4, 8, 12, and 15

### Monitoring Tips
- Weekly scan takes ~10 minutes for a class of 25
- Look for students who haven't posted in 2+ weeks
- Highlight exemplary posts to model good participation
- Intervene early if discussion becomes negative or unproductive

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Low initial participation**: Post your own technical question to model vulnerability
- **Surface-level posts**: Share example of good post vs. weak post
- **Gaming attempts**: Emphasize checkpoints evaluate pattern over time, not single weeks
- **Dominance by few students**: Privately encourage quiet students, assign "discussion leader" roles

### Integration with Course
- Reference discussion posts in lectures ("Great question from the discussion about...")
- Use common challenges from discussion to inform supplemental materials
- Encourage cross-referencing between chapter content and project work
- Consider bonus points for "Post of the Week" to incentivize quality
