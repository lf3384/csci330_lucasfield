# Chapter 6 Solutions: Compile-Time Polymorphism

This directory contains complete solutions for all Chapter 6 problems, focusing on templates and compile-time polymorphism.

## Solution Files Overview

### Problem Set 1: Function Template Fundamentals
- **problem_1_1_solution.cpp** - Basic function template (`absolute_value`)
- **problem_1_2_solution.cpp** - Multiple template parameters (`safe_divide`)  
- **problem_1_3_solution.cpp** - Template argument deduction (`swap`)

### Problem Set 2: Template Classes
- **problem_2_1_solution.cpp** - Simple template container (`Pair` class)
- **problem_2_2_solution.cpp** - Dynamic storage template (`SimpleArray` class)

### Problem Set 3: Applied Templates and Debugging
- **problem_3_1_solution.cpp** - Template specialization (`Printer` class)
- **problem_3_2_solution.cpp** - Debugging template errors (fixed buggy code)

## How to Use These Solutions

### For Students:
1. **Try the problems first** - Don't look at solutions until you've attempted the problems
2. **Compare your approach** - Your solution might be different but equally valid
3. **Read the comments** - Each solution includes detailed explanations
4. **Test with different types** - Try the solutions with various data types

### For Instructors:
1. **Expected completion times** are based on average student performance
2. **Key learning points** are highlighted in comments for each solution
3. **Additional test cases** are included to reinforce concepts
4. **Error explanations** in Problem 3.2 help students understand debugging

## Compilation Instructions

All solutions can be compiled with:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 problem_X_Y_solution.cpp -o solution
./solution
```

Some solutions use C++11 features like `auto` and trailing return types, so the `-std=c++11` flag is recommended.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Template Fundamentals
- Template function syntax: `template<typename T>`
- Type deduction vs explicit specification
- Multiple template parameters
- Template classes and instantiation

### Memory Management
- Dynamic allocation in template classes
- Proper destructor implementation
- Copy constructor considerations (deletion vs implementation)

### Template Specialization
- General template vs specialized versions
- Static methods in template classes
- Compile-time polymorphism concepts

### Debugging Skills
- Common template error patterns
- Reading template error messages
- Type requirement understanding

## Comparison to Other Languages

Each solution includes comments comparing C++ templates to:
- **Java Generics**: Type erasure vs template instantiation
- **Python Duck Typing**: Compile-time vs runtime type checking
- **C++ Virtual Functions**: Compile-time vs runtime polymorphism

## Performance Notes

Template solutions demonstrate:
- **No runtime overhead** - all decisions made at compile time
- **Code generation** - separate code created for each type used
- **Type safety** - all type checking done during compilation
- **Potential code bloat** - multiple instantiations increase executable size

## Expected Learning Outcomes

After reviewing these solutions, students should understand:
1. How templates provide type-safe generic programming
2. The difference between compile-time and runtime polymorphism
3. How to debug common template errors
4. When to use templates vs other C++ features
5. How C++ templates compare to similar features in other languages

These solutions support the chapter goal of introducing templates as a practical tool for code reuse while maintaining the type safety that C++ provides.
