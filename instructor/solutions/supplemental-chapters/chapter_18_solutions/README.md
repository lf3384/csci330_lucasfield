# Chapter 18: Algorithms - Solutions (Supplemental)

This supplemental chapter covers the STL algorithms library for efficient data processing and manipulation.

## Problem Solutions

### Problem Set 1: Data Processing Pipeline
- Sales data analysis using filter, transform, and reduce operations
- Text processing with STL algorithms

### Problem Set 2: Custom Algorithm Development
- Mathematical algorithms for statistical operations
- Advanced search and sort implementations

## Key Concepts Covered
- Non-modifying sequence operations (find, count, search)
- Modifying sequence operations (transform, replace, remove)
- Sorting and related operations
- Numeric algorithms (accumulate, inner_product)
- Set operations on sorted ranges
- Performance considerations and algorithm selection
