# Chapter 4: Object Lifecycle - Solution Templates

## New Assignment Structure

This chapter now uses **2 comprehensive projects** instead of 9 micro-problems:

### Core Assignment 1: Banking System with RAII (2 hours)
- **Files**: `banking_system_solution.cpp` *(To be created by instructor)*
- **Components**: 
  - Account hierarchy with multiple constructors
  - Transaction management with RAII patterns  
  - Lifecycle demonstration and logging
- **Skills**: Constructor overloading, virtual destructors, RAII patterns, exception safety

### Core Assignment 2: Resource Management Framework (2 hours)
- **Files**: `resource_manager_solution.cpp` *(To be created by instructor)*
- **Components**:
  - Dynamic memory manager template class
  - Advanced lifecycle patterns and dependency management
  - Integration with banking system
- **Skills**: Advanced RAII, memory management, object relationships, performance optimization

### Challenge Exercises Solutions
- **Directory**: `challenge_solutions/` *(To be created as needed)*
- **Content**: Solutions for 5 advanced challenge problems:
  1. Smart Pointer Implementation (45 min)
  2. Exception-Safe Programming (40 min)  
  3. Custom Memory Allocators (50 min)
  4. Profiling and Optimization (35 min)
  5. Thread-Safe RAII (55 min)

## Assessment Alignment

Solutions align with the new comprehensive rubric:
- **Core Assignment 1 (50%)**: RAII implementation, object design, functionality
- **Core Assignment 2 (50%)**: Memory management, advanced patterns, integration  
- **Challenge Exercises (up to +25% bonus)**: Depth, innovation, analysis

## Instructor Notes

1. **RAII Focus**: Solutions should exemplify automatic resource management
2. **Professional Quality**: Code should demonstrate industry best practices
3. **Educational Value**: Include debugging scenarios and common mistake prevention
4. **Scalability**: Show how concepts apply to larger systems

This structure provides **much deeper learning** through comprehensive projects while maintaining clear assessment criteria.
