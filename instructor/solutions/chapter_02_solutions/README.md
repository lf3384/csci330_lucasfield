# Chapter 2: Types - Solution Templates

## New Assignment Structure

This chapter now uses **2 comprehensive assignments** instead of multiple micro-problems:

### Core Assignment 1: Type System Exploration
- **File**: `type_explorer_solution.cpp` *(To be created by instructor)*
- **Components**: Type analysis, conversion demonstration, multi-unit converter, scope analysis
- **Skills**: Type system mastery, conversion understanding, scope awareness

### Core Assignment 2: Memory and Data Structures  
- **File**: `student_manager_solution.cpp` *(To be created by instructor)*
- **Components**: Student management system with arrays, pointers, structs, and memory safety
- **Skills**: Memory management, pointer arithmetic, struct design, defensive programming

### Challenge Exercises Solutions
- **Directory**: `challenge_solutions/` *(To be created as needed)*
- **Content**: Solutions for 6 optional challenge problems
- **Purpose**: Reference implementations for advanced students

## Notes for Instructors

1. **Solution Philosophy**: Focus on demonstrating best practices and multiple approaches
2. **Code Quality**: Solutions should be exemplary (comments, error handling, professional structure)
3. **Learning Scaffolding**: Include intermediate steps and debugging hints
4. **Alternative Approaches**: Show different valid solutions where appropriate

## Assessment Integration

Solutions align with the new rubric:
- **Core Assignment 1 (40%)**: Understanding, implementation, analysis
- **Core Assignment 2 (40%)**: Functionality, memory management, safety
- **Challenge Exercises (20% bonus)**: Optional advanced work
