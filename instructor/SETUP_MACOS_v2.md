   ```
   cd ~/Desktop
   ```
   
   Then clone (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cpp.git
   ```
   
   Enter the folder:
   ```
   cd cpp
   ```

4. **Connect to course updates**
   ```
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR_USERNAME/cpp.git
   ```

5. **Verify it worked**
   ```
   git remote -v
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** Shows 4 lines with "origin" and "upstream"

## Step 5: Build Your Environment (5 minutes)

**What it does:** Creates your C++ development container

### Do this:
1. **Make sure you're in the right place**
   In Terminal:
   ```
   cd ~/Desktop/cpp
   ```

2. **Build the container** (this takes 3-5 minutes - be patient!)
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```
   - You'll see lots of text scrolling - that's normal
   - **Apple Silicon Macs:** You'll see a platform warning - ignore it!
   - Get coffee while it builds

3. **Test it**
   ```
   docker run --rm cpp-course:latest g++ --version
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** "g++ (GCC) 11.x.x"

### If something went wrong:
<details>
<summary>Click here for fixes</summary>

**"Cannot connect to Docker daemon"**
- Check whale icon in menu bar
- If not there, open Docker from Applications

**Build taking forever on Apple Silicon**
- This is normal! Your Mac is converting Intel code
- Go get lunch, it'll finish eventually

**"docker-compose: command not found"**
- Restart Docker Desktop
- Wait for whale icon to reappear
</details>

## Step 6: Connect VSCode to Docker (5 minutes)

**What it does:** Makes VSCode use your container automatically

### Do this:
1. **Open your project**
   In Terminal:
   ```
   cd ~/Desktop/cpp
   ```
   ```
   code .
   ```
   (The dot is important!) - it opens VSCode

2. **Create config folder**
   In VSCode:
   - Look at left sidebar (file explorer)
   - Right-click in empty area
   - Click "New Folder"
   - Name it: `.vscode` (with the dot!)

3. **Create config file**
   - Right-click the `.vscode` folder
   - Click "New File"
   - Name it: `devcontainer.json`
   - Copy and paste this EXACTLY:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "C++ Development",
     "dockerComposeFile": "../docker-compose.yml",
     "service": "cpp-dev",
     "workspaceFolder": "/workspace",
     "extensions": [
       "ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack"
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Save with Command+S

4. **Start the container**
   - Press F1 (or Command+Shift+P)
   - Type: reopen in container
   - Click "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   - First time takes 2-3 minutes - be patient!

5. **Test everything**
   When VSCode reloads:
   - Look at bottom left - should say "Dev Container: C++ Development"  
   - Click Terminal â†’ New Terminal (or press Control+`)
   - In the terminal, type:
   ```
   g++ --version
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** Terminal shows "g++ (GCC) 11.x.x"

6. **Run your first program**
   In the VSCode terminal, copy/paste:
   ```
   echo '#include <iostream>
   int main() { std::cout << "Setup complete!\\n"; }' > test.cpp
   ```
   
   Then compile:
   ```
   g++ test.cpp -o test
   ```
   
   Then run:
   ```
   ./test
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** "Setup complete!"

## You're Done! ðŸŽ‰

### Daily routine (30 seconds):
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running (check menu bar for whale)
2. Open Terminal
3. Type: `cd ~/Desktop/cpp && code .`
4. Press F1 â†’ type "reopen" â†’ select "Reopen in Container"
5. Start coding!

### Quick Reference:

| I want to... | Where? | Command/Action |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Write code | VSCode | Just type! |
| Compile code | VSCode Terminal | `g++ myfile.cpp -o myprogram` |
| Run program | VSCode Terminal | `./myprogram` |
| Save work | VSCode | Command+S |
| Submit homework | Terminal.app | `git add .` then `git commit -m "Done"` then `git push` |

### Which terminal do I use?
- **Terminal.app**: Git commands, opening projects
- **VSCode Terminal**: ALL C++ work (compiling, running)
- Easy way to remember: If VSCode is open, use its terminal

---

## Common Problems & Solutions

### "It's not working!"

1. **First, always try:**
   - Is Docker Desktop running? (check menu bar for whale)
   - Restart VSCode
   - Restart your Mac

2. **VSCode can't find container:**
   - Delete the `.vscode` folder
   - Recreate it following Step 6

3. **"Permission denied" errors:**
   - System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy â†’ Privacy
   - Give Terminal and VSCode access to folders

4. **Apple Silicon platform warnings:**
   - These are NORMAL - just ignore them
   - Your code will still work perfectly

5. **Can't push to GitHub:**
   - GitHub now requires tokens instead of passwords
   - Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Personal Access Tokens
   - Generate one and use it as your password

6. **Terminal says "zsh" instead of "bash":**
   - This is normal on newer Macs
   - Both work the same for our purposes

### Still stuck?
- Take a screenshot of the error
- Note which step you're on  
- Ask in office hours or Discord/Forum
