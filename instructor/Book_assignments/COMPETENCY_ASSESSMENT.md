# C++ Competency Assessment Framework

## üéØ Competency-Based Learning

This assessment framework focuses on **demonstrable skills** rather than perfect scores. Students progress when they can **do** C++ programming, not just answer questions about it.

**Philosophy**: "Can you build working programs that solve real problems?"

---

## üìä Assessment Overview

### Three Competency Levels
- **Developing** (D): Learning the concept, needs support
- **Proficient** (P): Can apply concept independently  
- **Advanced** (A): Can teach concept to others, extend creatively

### Four Assessment Methods
1. **Practical Demonstrations** - Show your code working
2. **Code Reviews** - Explain your design decisions
3. **Problem Solving** - Apply concepts to new situations
4. **Portfolio Building** - Accumulate evidence of growth

## üìã Assessment Methods Detail

### Method 1: Practical Demonstrations (40%)
**Show your working code and explain it**

#### Format
- **5-10 minute individual sessions**
- **Student demonstrates code** running and explains key concepts
- **Instructor asks follow-up questions** to verify understanding
- **Focus on process** - how you think through problems

#### Example Questions
- "Show me your debugging process for this memory issue"
- "Walk me through how this polymorphism works"
- "Explain why you chose vector over list here"
- "Demonstrate how RAII prevents resource leaks"

#### Scoring
- **D**: Code works with help, basic understanding
- **P**: Code works independently, solid understanding  
- **A**: Code works well, can explain alternatives and trade-offs

### Method 2: Code Reviews (25%)
**Present your design decisions and receive feedback**

#### Format
- **Submit code via GitHub** with documentation
- **Brief written explanation** of design choices
- **Peer and instructor feedback** on approach
- **Reflection on feedback** and potential improvements

#### Review Criteria
- **Functionality**: Does it solve the problem correctly?
- **Design**: Are classes and functions well-organized?
- **Modern C++**: Uses contemporary features appropriately?
- **Safety**: Avoids common C++ pitfalls?
- **Clarity**: Easy for others to understand?

#### Scoring
- **D**: Basic functionality, needs improvement
- **P**: Good solution, incorporates feedback well
- **A**: Excellent design, teaches others through example

### Method 3: Problem Solving (25%)
**Apply your skills to new challenges**

#### Format
- **Novel problems** not directly from chapters
- **Choice of approaches** - multiple valid solutions
- **Scaffolded complexity** - build up from simple to complex
- **Real-world contexts** - problems that matter

#### Example Problem Types
- **Integration challenges**: Combine multiple chapters' concepts
- **Performance problems**: Optimize existing code
- **Design problems**: Architect systems for requirements
- **Legacy modernization**: Update old C++ to modern style

#### Scoring
- **D**: Attempts solution, needs guidance
- **P**: Solves problem effectively with good approach
- **A**: Elegant solution, considers multiple approaches

### Method 4: Portfolio Building (10%)
**Accumulate evidence of learning over time**

#### Portfolio Contents
- **Best work samples** from each competency area
- **Learning reflection** - what you've discovered
- **Growth documentation** - before/after code comparisons
- **Teaching artifacts** - explanations you've created for others

#### Portfolio Reviews
- **Mid-term portfolio check** - ensure progress on track
- **Final portfolio presentation** - showcase best work
- **Peer portfolio sharing** - learn from others' approaches

## üìä Grade Conversion (If Required)

### Competency to Grade Mapping
- **All competencies at Advanced (A)**: A grade
- **Most competencies at Proficient (P), some Advanced**: B grade  
- **All competencies at Proficient (P)**: C grade
- **Most competencies at Developing (D), working toward Proficient**: D grade

### Focus on Growth
- **Improvement trajectory** matters more than starting point
- **Multiple attempts** allowed for competency demonstrations
- **Support provided** to reach proficiency in all areas
- **Success defined** as professional competency, not perfect scores

## üéì Student Success Strategies

### How to Excel in Competency Assessment

#### Build Your Portfolio Continuously
- **Save your best work** from each chapter
- **Document your learning** with reflection notes
- **Show growth over time** with before/after examples
- **Help others learn** - teaching demonstrates mastery

#### Prepare for Demonstrations
- **Practice explaining your code** to others
- **Understand alternatives** - why did you choose this approach?
- **Be ready to debug** - show your systematic process
- **Connect concepts** - how do different chapters relate?

#### Seek Feedback Early and Often
- **Ask for code reviews** before formal assessment
- **Get help when stuck** - don't struggle alone
- **Learn from peers** - different approaches teach you
- **Iterate and improve** - first draft is rarely best

#### Focus on Understanding, Not Memorization
- **Competency means you can DO** - not just recite
- **Apply concepts creatively** - solve new problems
- **Explain in your own words** - true understanding shows
- **Make connections** - link C++ to your prior experience
