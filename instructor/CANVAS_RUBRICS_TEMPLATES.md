## üìä Rubric Design Philosophy

### **Three-Level Mastery Scale**
- **Developing (D)**: Learning the concept, needs support
- **Proficient (P)**: Can apply concept independently  
- **Advanced (A)**: Can teach concept to others, extend creatively

### **Four Assessment Dimensions**
1. **Functionality**: Does the code work correctly?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-organized and readable?
3. **Modern C++ Usage**: Uses contemporary features appropriately?
4. **Problem-Solving Process**: Demonstrates systematic approach?

**Total Points: /16 (Can be scaled to different point values)**

### **Point Conversion Scale**
```
16 points = A (100%)
15 points = A (94%)
14 points = A- (88%)
13 points = B+ (81%)
12 points = B (75%)
11 points = B- (69%)
10 points = C+ (63%)
