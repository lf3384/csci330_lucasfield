# Windows Setup Guide - CSCI 330

**Total Time:** 20-30 minutes  
**Read only this guide** - Mac and Linux users have their own

---

## Before You Start

**You'll need:**
- Windows 10 or 11
- Admin access to your computer
- Stable internet connection
- Your GitHub account

**What we're installing:**
1. WSL2 (Linux inside Windows)
2. Docker Desktop (container platform)
3. Git (version control)
4. VSCode (code editor)

---

## Step 1: Install WSL2 (5 minutes)

**What it does:** Runs Linux inside Windows so everyone has the same environment

### Do this:
1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**
   - Press Windows key
   - Type "powershell"
   - Right-click "Windows PowerShell"
   - Click "Run as administrator"

2. **Install WSL2**
   ```
   wsl --install
   ```
   - Press Enter and wait
   - When it says "restart required", restart your computer

3. **After restart** (Ubuntu window will open)
   - Create a username (lowercase, no spaces)
   - Create a password (you won't see it typing - that's normal)
   - Write these down!

4. **Verify it worked**
   Open PowerShell (regular, not admin) and type:
   ```
   wsl --status
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** "Default Version: 2"

### If something went wrong:

**"WSL not recognized"**
```
wsl --install
```
If that doesn't work, restart and try again.

**Ubuntu didn't open after restart**
- Open Microsoft Store
- Search "Ubuntu"
- Click "Open"
</details>

## Step 2: Install Docker Desktop (5 minutes)

**What it does:** Creates consistent C++ environment for everyone

### Do this:
1. **Download Docker Desktop**
   - Go to: https://docker.com
   - Click the big blue "Download Docker Desktop" button
   - Save the file

2. **Install Docker**
   - Run the downloaded file
   - When asked, CHECK: "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V"
   - Click OK for restart

3. **After restart**
   - Docker Desktop opens automatically
   - Wait for whale icon in system tray (bottom right)
   - If terms appear, just accept them

4. **Configure Docker**
   - Click whale icon â†’ Settings
   - Click "Resources" â†’ "WSL Integration"
   - Turn ON the toggle for "Ubuntu"
   - Click "Apply & restart"

5. **Verify it worked**
   Open PowerShell and type:
   ```
   docker --version
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** "Docker version 24.x.x" (any number is fine)

### If something went wrong:
<details>
<summary>Click here for fixes</summary>

**Docker won't start**
- Restart your computer (really, this fixes 90% of issues)

**Still broken?**
- Uninstall Docker Desktop
- Restart computer
- Install again
</details>

## Step 3: Install Git and VSCode (5 minutes)

**What they do:** Git tracks your code, VSCode is where you write it

### Do this:

#### Part A: Install Git
1. **Download Git**
   - Go to: https://git-scm.com
   - Click "Download for Windows"
   - Run the installer
   - Click "Next" for EVERYTHING (use all defaults)

2. **Configure Git for Windows**
   Open PowerShell and copy/paste these lines (press Enter after each):
   ```
   git config --global core.autocrlf input
   ```
   ```
   git config --global core.eol lf
   ```

#### Part B: Install VSCode
1. **Download VSCode**
   - Go to: https://code.visualstudio.com
   - Click "Download for Windows"
   - Run installer (all defaults are fine)

2. **Add Extensions**
   - Open VSCode
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (holds Ctrl and Shift, tap X)
   - Search and install these one by one:
     - C/C++ Extension Pack (by Microsoft)
     - Dev Containers (by Microsoft)
     - Docker (by Microsoft)
   - Close VSCode when done

3. **Verify it worked**
   Open PowerShell and type:
   ```
   git --version
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** "git version 2.x.x"

## Step 4: Get Course Files (5 minutes)

**What it does:** Downloads the course materials to your computer

### Do this:
1. **Set up Git** (use YOUR actual name and email)
   Open PowerShell and type these (replace the text in quotes):
   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your Actual Name"
   ```
   ```
   git config --global user.email "your.email@university.edu"
   ```

2. **Fork the course repository**
   - Go to: https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR_USERNAME/cpp
   - Click "Fork" button (top right)
   - Wait for it to copy
   - You now have your own copy!

3. **Download your fork**
   In PowerShell, copy/paste these lines one at a time:
   
   First, go to Desktop:
   ```
   cd Desktop
   ```
   
   Then clone (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cpp.git
   ```
   
   Enter the folder:
   ```
   cd cpp
   ```

4. **Connect to course updates**
   ```
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/INSTRUCTOR_USERNAME/cpp.git
   ```

5. **Verify it worked**
   ```
   git remote -v
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** Shows 4 lines with "origin" and "upstream"

---

## Step 5: Build Your Environment (5 minutes)

**What it does:** Creates your C++ development container

### Do this:
1. **Make sure you're in the right place**
   In PowerShell:
   ```
   cd Desktop\cpp
   ```

2. **Build the container** (this takes 3-5 minutes - be patient!)
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```
   - You'll see lots of text scrolling - that's normal
   - Get coffee while it builds

3. **Test it**
   ```
   docker run --rm cpp-course:latest g++ --version
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** "g++ (GCC) 11.x.x"

### If something went wrong:
<details>
<summary>Click here for fixes</summary>

**"docker-compose not found"**
- Close PowerShell
- Open new PowerShell
- Try again

**"Cannot connect to Docker"**
- Check whale icon in system tray
- If not there, start Docker Desktop from Start Menu
</details>

---

## Step 6: Connect VSCode to Docker (5 minutes)

**What it does:** Makes VSCode use your container automatically

### Do this:
1. **Open VSCode**
   - Open VSCode from Start Menu
   - Click File â†’ Open Folder
   - Navigate to Desktop â†’ cpp
   - Click "Select Folder"

2. **Create config file**
   - In VSCode, press `Ctrl+Shift+E` (opens file explorer on left)
   - Right-click in file area
   - Click "New Folder"
   - Name it: `.vscode` (with the dot!)
   - Right-click the .vscode folder
   - Click "New File"  
   - Name it: `devcontainer.json`
   - Copy and paste this EXACTLY:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "C++ Development",
     "dockerComposeFile": "../docker-compose.yml",
     "service": "cpp-dev",
     "workspaceFolder": "/workspace",
     "extensions": [
       "ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack"
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Save with `Ctrl+S`

3. **Start the container**
   - Press `F1` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - Type: reopen in container
   - Click "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   - First time takes 2-3 minutes - be patient!

4. **Test everything**
   When VSCode reloads:
   - Look at bottom left - should say "Dev Container: C++ Development"
   - Click Terminal â†’ New Terminal (or press `Ctrl+``)
   - In the terminal, type:
   ```
   g++ --version
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** Terminal shows "g++ (GCC) 11.x.x"

5. **Run your first program**
   In the terminal, copy/paste:
   ```
   echo '#include <iostream>
   int main() { std::cout << "Setup complete!\\n"; }' > test.cpp
   ```
   
   Then compile:
   ```
   g++ test.cpp -o test
   ```
   
   Then run:
   ```
   ./test
   ```
   
   âœ… **Success looks like:** "Setup complete!"

## You're Done! ðŸŽ‰

### Daily routine (30 seconds):
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running (check system tray)
2. Open VSCode
3. Open your cpp folder
4. Press F1 â†’ type "reopen" â†’ select "Reopen in Container"
5. Start coding!

### Quick Reference:

| I want to... | Where? | Command/Action |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Write code | VSCode | Just type! |
| Compile code | VSCode Terminal | `g++ myfile.cpp -o myprogram` |
| Run program | VSCode Terminal | `./myprogram` |
| Save work | VSCode | `Ctrl+S` |
| Submit homework | PowerShell | `git add .` then `git commit -m "Done"` then `git push` |

### Which terminal do I use?
- **PowerShell**: Git commands, checking versions
- **VSCode Terminal**: ALL C++ work (compiling, running)
- Easy way to remember: If VSCode is open, use its terminal

---

## Common Problems & Solutions

### "It's not working!"

1. **First, always try:**
   - Is Docker Desktop running? (check system tray for whale)
   - Restart VSCode
   - Restart computer

2. **VSCode can't find container:**
   - Delete the `.vscode` folder
   - Recreate it following Step 6

3. **Strange ^M characters:**
   - You skipped the Git configuration
   - Run these in PowerShell:
   ```
   git config --global core.autocrlf input
   git config --global core.eol lf
   ```

4. **"Permission denied":**
   - Don't put files in OneDrive folders
   - Use Desktop or Documents instead

### Still stuck?
- Take a screenshot of the error
- Note which step you're on
- Ask in office hours or Discord/Forum
